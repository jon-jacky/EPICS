vdb.py
======

**vdb.py** generates a data flow graph from an EPICS database.  

How it works
------------

**vdb.py** uses *parseDb* in
[epicsUtils](http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/bii_scripts/html/python/epicsUtils.html)
(download
[here](http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/bii_scripts/repo/bii_scripts/lib/python/epicsUtils.py))
from [BESSY](http://www-csr.bessy.de/) to load an EPICS database file
into a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per EPICS record, where
the dictionary keys are the field names (with one additional key,
*recordname*).  Then *vdb.py* generates a script in the *dot* graph
language where each node is an EPICS record and each edge is a link:
INP, OUT, FLNK, etc.  The edges are labelled so that they indicate
control flow as well as data flow.

**vdb.py** sends the *dot* graph script to standard output.  We
usually redirect it to a *.dot* file.  Then our *dotsvg* script uses
the *dot* graph layout program from the
[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) package to generate an *.svg*
graphics file, which can be viewed in a browser.  The layout
generated by *dot* usually makes the data flow and
control flow clear.
